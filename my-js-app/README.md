This is a javascript program that allows you to input any numbers of your choice and returns a specific result to determine if it is even or odd. The program is divided into 3 tasks and each task carries its own function. 

For the first task, a function is called and it returns an array. The function makes use of 'readlineSync'
to allow the program to run in the terminal of VS code. It uses a prompt to ask users to input any numbers of their choice. An even number is squared and an odd number is tripled.

In the second task, the user is prompted to enter a desired number of strings. A string that corresponds to an even number is capitalized whereas that of an odd number is lowercased: all based on the array of numbers already requested.

The third task creates a a new file and imports the function in the second task to be used. It returns the values of all the functions in the previous file as an array of objects. It groups each element of the array based on the original string input by the user, the modified string and automatically assigns an ID number to each of them.
